I originally entered school for business, but quickly became interested in the
limitless potential a software engineer has at his or her disposal.

After playing with code for a while, I decided to learn more and pursue a CS degree.
However, the slow teaching pace and small amount of exposure to larger projects

Coming out to Colorado for an accelerated program at gSchool has been
much more satisfying and has me excited to hit the ground running.
